# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Hello! My name is Guadalupe Vargas and I come from Coachella. My pronouns are she/her. Currently, my favorite games are Stardew Valley and Fields of Mistria. They're what I would describe as farming RPGs. I am also currently playing Slime Rancher 2 which I find to be fun and relaxing. I am taking the class as I would like to, in the future, posssibly create video games. To add, I am also really interested in the programming aspect of video games. The process fascinates me and I like that it is a creative process. I do not have any prior experience with game development. But, I hope to be able to create RPGs in the future.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [X] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. I hope to be able to become more proficient with GitHub and also learn the basics of C#.
4. I am most nervous about coding. While setting up the tools, there were so many icons and drop-down lists that I became a bit overwhelmed. In addition, being new at something typically makes me a bit anxious, but it also excites me to be able to learn something new.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks) -- N/A

2. Game development (any engine)           -- N/A

3. Unity                                   -- N/A

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document               -- N/A

2. Scope management                   -- N/A
